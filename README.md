# WPForms EPFL Payonline

[WPForms EPFL Payonline] is a [WPForms] addon that allows the
use of [EPFL Payonline] as a payment gateway.

Consider yourself warned..._

### Releasing

This project carries some comfort scripts that made the releasing process
easier, such as automated version, updated translation file, package creation,
git support, ... 

You can have a look to the [bump-version.sh], [create-gh-release.sh] and
[Makefile] files.

_Note:_ you need to create a [personal access token] and add it to your
`WPEP_GH_TOKEN` environment var, in order that the GitHub release can be created.

#### Here are some useful commands:

1. **Create a release**: `make release`  
   It will run some checks, bump version, create/update the translation
   (gettext) files, create the zip package, add and commit (if requested) files,
   create a tag according to the version and finally call the
   [create-gh-release.sh] script. It should result in a freshly created [latest
   release].

1. **Update the translation**: `make pot`  
   It will use the `wp i18n make-pot` command and the gettext's `msgmerge`,
   `msginit` and `msgfmt` boogaloo to create or update the
   `languages/wpforms-epfl-payonline.pot`,
   `languages/wpforms-epfl-payonline-fr_FR.po`,
   `languages/wpforms-epfl-payonline-fr_FR.mo` files.

1. **Create a new package**: `make zip`  
   Create a zip archive in the `/builds` directory, excluding unwanted files and
   directories. Also create 2 symbolic links `wpforms-epfl-payonline.zip` and
   `latest.zip` pointing to the last released version.

1. **Change the version**: `make version` (default to patch)  
   This will change version number in [wpforms-epfl-payonline.php], using [semver](https://semver.org/). Available options are:
   * `make version-patch`
   * `make version-minor`
   * `make version-major`
